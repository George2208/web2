		<h1>Windows vs Linux</h1>
		<p>Which operating system you use says a lot about you. If you use Linux, you're an advanced PC user that likes customisable software with more functionality, if you use Windows, you're pretty much everyone else without a MacBook. These two OS' have been long considered the best two options for laptops and PCs, but they are drastically different systems.</p>
		<p>Windows is Microsoft's famous option, arguably the first OS many of us learn to use as most laptops come pre-loaded with it. It's a favourite of businesses and the most obvious choice for consumers on account of it being easy to use and fairly cheap.Then there's Linux, which is nowhere near as famous and considerably more complex. With this OS, you can do far more than you can with Windows. This is because Linux is built on an open-source foundation that makes it both customisable and, probably, more intimidating to the everyday user.</p>
		<p>A common feature of Linux OS' is the ability to live' boot them that is, booting from a DVD or USB image without having to actually install the OS on your machine. This can be a great way to quickly test out if you like a distro without having to commit to it.The distro can then be installed from within the live-booted OS, or simply run live for as long as you need. However, while more polished distros such as Ubuntu are a doddle to set up, some of the less user-friendly examples require a great deal more technical know-how to get up and running.Windows installations, by contrast, while more lengthy and time consuming, are a lot simpler, requiring a minimum of user input compared to many distros.</p>
		<p>Users who are considering making a change from Windows to Linux or Linux to Windows commonly want to know the advantages and disadvantages of each operating system. Below is a chart to help illustrate the major advantages and disadvantages of each of these operating systems.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Price</td>
				<td>The Linux kernel, and the GNU utilities and libraries which accompany it in most distributions, are entirely free and open source. You can download and install GNU/Linux distributions without purchase. Some companies offer paid support for their Linux distributions, but the underlying software is still free to download and install.</td>
				<td>Microsoft Windows usually costs between $99.00 and $199.00 USD for each licensed copy. Windows 10 was originally being offered as a free upgrade to current owners of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 if they upgraded before July 29, 2016, but that offer is no longer available.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Reliability</td>
				<td>Linux is notoriously reliable and secure. It has a strong focus on process management, system security, and uptime. Users usually experience less issues in Linux.</td>
				<td>Although Microsoft Windows has made great improvements in reliability in recent years, it's considered less reliable than Linux. Many of the sacrifices it makes in the name of user-friendliness can lead to security vulnerabilities and system instability.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Software</td>
				<td>There are thousands of programs available for Linux, and many are available as easy-to-install software packages â€” all for free. Also, many Windows programs can be run on Linux using compatibility layers, such as WINE. Linux supports a wider array of free software than Windows.</td>
				<td>Windows commands the highest number of desktop users, and therefore the largest selection of software. It also has the largest selection of video games by a wide margin.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Software cost</td>
				<td>Many of the available software programs, utilities, and games available on Linux are free and open source. Even complex applications, such as GIMP, OpenOffice, and Star Office, are available for free.</td>
				<td>Although there are many free Windows programs, utilities, and games, the majority of Windows software is commercial and must be purchased. Most Windows software can cost between $4.99 and $99.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Security</td>
				<td>Linux is a highly secure operating system. Although attack vectors are still discovered, its source code is open and available for any user to review, which makes it easier to identify and repair vulnerabilities.</td>
				<td>Microsoft has made great security improvements in Windows over the years. But as the operating system with the largest user base, especially among novice computer users, it is the primary target for malicious coders. As a result, of all major operating systems, Microsoft Windows is the most likely to be the victim of viruses and malware.</td>
